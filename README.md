# HTML-Scraping-Challenge

## Background
  For this project I was tasked with Two Parts:
  Part 1: 
    Scrape a given website of all the titles and preview text associated with a title article and store it into a dictionary.

  Part 2:
    Scrape a given mars website table and store the information into a Pandas Data Frame.
    Then analysize the Data Frame to determine the following:
      How many months exist on Mars? 
      How many Martian days' worth of data are there? 
      Which month, on average, has the lowest temperature? The highest? 
      Which month, on average, has the lowest atmospheric pressure? The highest? 
      How many terrestrial days exist in a Martian year?
      Add data visualization was created to support each answer
